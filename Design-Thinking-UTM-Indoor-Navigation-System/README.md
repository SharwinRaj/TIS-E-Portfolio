# Design Thinking – Low Fidelity Prototype

## Description
This project was completed as part of the Technology and Information System course and involved applying the design thinking approach to address a real-world problem through a technology-based solution.

The project followed the key stages of design thinking, including empathy, problem definition, ideation, and the development of a low fidelity prototype. The main focus was on understanding user needs and proposing a practical solution before moving into technical implementation.

## Reflection
Through this project, I learned the importance of user-centred design and structured problem-solving. The design thinking process emphasised careful planning, collaboration, and iteration before developing a solution. This experience helped me understand that effective technology solutions begin with a strong understanding of user needs and clear problem definition.
