# PC Assembly Laboratory

## Description
As part of the Technology and Information System (SECP1513) course, I participated in a PC assembly laboratory session conducted at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The session focused on hands-on exploration of the internal components of a desktop computer.

During the activity, we identified and examined key hardware components such as the motherboard, processor, power supply unit, storage devices, cooling system, and internal cabling. The session helped illustrate how individual components work together to form a complete and functional computer system.

## Reflection
This laboratory session enhanced my understanding of computer hardware beyond theoretical knowledge. By physically interacting with the components, I gained clearer insight into system architecture and hardware functionality. The experience strengthened my foundational knowledge of computing systems and highlighted the importance of practical exposure in understanding real-world technology.
