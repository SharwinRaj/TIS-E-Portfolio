# UTM Digital Open Day

## Description
On 29 October 2025, I attended the UTM Digital Open Day organised by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The event introduced various technology-related organisations and initiatives, providing students with exposure to current developments in the technology industry.

During the event, organisations such as Oracle Academy and DRON Malaysia shared insights into their technologies and services. Topics discussed included database systems, cloud computing, programming, artificial intelligence, and intelligent surveillance systems.

## Reflection
This event helped me gain better awareness of how technology is applied in real-world settings. Learning about different organisations and their technological solutions motivated me to further explore areas such as data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, and to better align my academic goals with industry needs.
