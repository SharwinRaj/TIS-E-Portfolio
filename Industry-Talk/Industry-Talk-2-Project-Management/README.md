# Industry Talk 2: Project Management & System Development

## Description
I attended Industry Talk 2: Project Management & System Development at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The session discussed industry expectations for computer science graduates, particularly in relation to project management and system development processes.

Key topics included the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), data structures, system design, and the appropriate use of artificial intelligence tools to support productivity.

## Reflection
This session helped me understand that success in the technology industry requires more than programming skills. Planning, collaboration, and effective communication are equally important. The emphasis on balancing core technical knowledge with AI-assisted tools influenced how I approach my academic learning and future career preparation.
